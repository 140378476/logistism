# Logistism

A simple logistics system, in which users can post orders of delivery, 
postmen can be assigned to retrieve and deliver orders and managers can 
monitor the state of the system. 
Items will be delivered through the network
of scheduled shipments, and the shipping plans will be created in advance.
In addition, shipping logs are maintained so that users can be acknowledged of 
the latest information about their goods.
